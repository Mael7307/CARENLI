The premise only states the treatment regimen but doesn't mention any results or comparisons. There's no control group, baseline data, or outcome data provided. Without data showing that this treatment leads to remission or better outcomes compared to a control or previous state, we can't confirm causation. \n\nCytarabine is a known chemotherapy drug for AML, so maybe there's prior knowledge, but the task is to base the decision solely on the premise.
