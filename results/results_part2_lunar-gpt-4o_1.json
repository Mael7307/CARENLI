Using clinical regularities, neutropenia is considered potentially life-threatening due to its high infection risk, even though it is less common (14.29%).

Firstly, doxorubicin is a standard chemotherapy agent used for neuroblastoma, and its known mechanism can achieve tumor shrinkage and possibly improve prognosis.
