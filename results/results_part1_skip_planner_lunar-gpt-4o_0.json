These observed symptoms (tonic-clonic movements, urinary incontinence) are consistent with seizure-like activity, but the context is clear that the underlying trigger was anaphylaxis\u2014a known severe allergic reaction requiring immediate intervention. The first seizure clinic (FIT clinic) typically evaluates patients presenting with unprovoked seizures to investigate underlying neurological conditions. In this case, the tonic-clonic movements and urinary incontinence could plausibly be anoxic seizures, secondary to hypoxia during the anaphylactic event, rather than unprovoked seizures. While it is theoretically possible that the patient warrants additional neurologic evaluation, the premise does not provide evidence suggesting such an evaluation is specifically indicated at this time, and the primary issue appears to be related to his allergic reaction.
