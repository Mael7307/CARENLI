High cumulative doses over short durations can lead to severe toxicities including cardiotoxicity. 3) The patient's age (4 months) and developmental immaturity heighten the potential risks and pharmacokinetic alterations that could impact treatment outcomes negatively rather than achieving the expected benefit of tumor shrinkage or prognosis improvement. 4) The statement assumes treatment outcomes (tumor shrinkage, prognosis improvement) without addressing whether such a high dosage in an infant can be safely administered or indeed achieve the anticipated effects.
