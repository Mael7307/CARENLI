Febrile neutropenia at this level is considered a high-risk situation according to current clinical guidelines, particularly given advanced age (over 65 years) and comorbidities that are common in older adults. Standard management for high-risk febrile neutropenia usually involves hospital admission, intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and close monitoring. In this case, the patient was managed as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, without hospital admission or IV antibiotics, and monitored via phone follow-up\u2014a strategy generally reserved for low-risk patients. Without further data justifying why this patient was considered low-risk despite the apparent high-risk factors, the appropriateness of the management deviates from established standards. Therefore, the adverse event management described contradicts established guidelines for high-risk febrile neutropenia.",
