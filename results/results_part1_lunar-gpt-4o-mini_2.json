Injection site pain, while common, is generally considered a minor adverse event compared to severe outcomes such as myocardial infarction, which, while reported only 3 times (4.29%), carries a high severity as it can lead to life-threatening complications. The highest patient risk should be aligned with the potential for severe outcomes rather than just frequency. Therefore, stating that the highest patient risk was associated with injection site pain does not reflect the comparative risk assessment of the severe outcomes presented in the adverse events. Thus, the statement contradicts the comparative risk understanding that severe outcomes outweigh common, minor events in assessing patient risk.",

Fatigue has a high frequency at 31.25%, but it is generally considered a minor adverse event with low severity. In comparison, serious adverse events like anaphylaxis and respiratory distress, although occurring less frequently (3.75% and 6.25% respectively), carry significantly higher severity given their potential for life-threatening outcomes. Therefore, while fatigue has the highest occurrence in terms of frequency, it does not translate into the highest risk when considering severity. The highest risk is more accurately associated with the rarer but more severe events (e.g., anaphylaxis).
