        "error_info": "Solution JSON error: <think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the core principles and the decision procedure outlined. The task is to determine whether the given statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral based on the risk assessment principles provided.\n\nStarting with the premise: The treatment-emergent adverse events are listed with their frequencies. Anemia and Hypertension each occurred in 2 out of 18 patients (11.11%), while Dizziness, Insomnia, and Constipation each occurred in 1 out of 18 (5.56%). \n\nThe statement says, \"While the treatment was beneficial, patients frequently experienced elevated blood pressure and sleep disturbances.\" \n\nFirst, I need to extract the candidates for adverse events (A) and plausible latent diagnoses (B) from both the premise and the statement. The premise mentions Hypertension (2/18) and Insomnia (1/18). The statement refers to \"elevated blood pressure\" which corresponds to Hypertension and \"sleep disturbances\" which would include Insomnia. \n\nNext, estimate the likelihood. Hypertension is at 11.11%, which is 2 out of 18. Insomnia is 5.56%, 1 out of 18. The statement uses the term \"frequently\" for both. However, 11.11% might not be considered \"frequent\" in some contexts, but in clinical trials, even 10% can be notable. However, \"frequently\" might imply a higher rate. The premise shows that Hypertension is 11.11% and Insomnia 5.56%. The statement combines both as \"frequently experienced,\" which might be an overstatement, especially for Insomnia at 5.56%. \n\nSeverity-wise, Hypertension is a serious condition, potentially leading to severe complications if untreated. Insomnia is generally considered a less severe adverse event, more of a moderate or minor issue unless it leads to significant impairment. \n\nComparing the statement's claim: \"frequently experienced elevated blood pressure and sleep disturbances.\" The premise reports Hypertension at 11.11% and Insomnia at 5.56%. The term \"frequently\" might be subjective. If the statement says both occurred frequently, but in reality, Hypertension is 11.11% and Insomnia is 5.56%, then \"frequently\" for Hypertension could be arguable, but for Insomnia, 5.56% is less likely to be considered frequent. However, the core principles mention that expected harm (likelihood \u00d7 severity) is more important than raw frequency. But in this case, the statement is about the frequency of occurrence, not the risk of harm. The problem is whether the statement accurately reflects the frequency reported in the premise.\n\nWait, the task is to evaluate the statement in terms of risk. Wait, no. Wait, the Risk Solver's role is to determine if the statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral based on patient risk. But the statement here is about the frequency of adverse events, not directly about risk. However, the core principles mention that the risk assessment involves expected harm (likelihood \u00d7 severity). But the statement is making a claim about the frequency of two adverse events. \n\nWait, the statement says \"patients frequently experienced elevated blood pressure and sleep disturbances.\" Elevated blood pressure is Hypertension (11.11%), and sleep disturbances would include Insomnia (5.56%). The term \"frequently\" here is key. In clinical contexts, \"frequent\" might be considered as occurring in a significant proportion, but there's no strict threshold. However, 11.11% (Hypertension) is 2 out of 18, which is about 1 in 9 patients. Is that considered frequent? Maybe in some contexts, but perhaps not. Similarly, 5.56% (1 in 18) for Insomnia is even lower. \n\nThe problem is whether the statement's assertion that these events occurred \"frequently\" is accurate based on the premise. If the premise reports 11.11% and 5.56%, and the statement says \"frequently,\" then this could be a contradiction because 11% might not be considered frequent, and 5.56% even less so. However, the term \"frequently\" is subjective. But according to the core principles, we need to use the provided information. The premise states the exact frequencies, and the statement uses \"frequently.\" \n\nIn the context of clinical trials, adverse events are often categorized by frequency terms. For example, the CIOMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences) defines \"Very common\" as \u226510%, \"Common\" as \u22651% and <10%, etc. If we follow that, then Hypertension at 11.11% would be \"very common,\" and Insomnia at 5.56% would be \"common.\" However, the statement uses \"frequently,\" which might align with \"very common\" or \"common.\" But the statement groups both as \"frequently,\" which might not be accurate for Insomnia. \n\nAlternatively, if the statement says \"frequently\" for both, but Hypertension is 11.11% (which could be considered frequent) and Insomnia is 5.56% (less frequent), then the two together might not both be \"frequently\" experienced. However, the statement uses \"frequently\" for both. \n\nTherefore, the statement's claim that both occurred frequently might be contradicted by the premise, as Insomnia's rate is lower. \n\nBut the core principles are about risk assessment, not just frequency. Wait, the problem is to evaluate the statement in terms of risk. Wait, the original instruction says: \"Decide whether the statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral by evaluating patient risk.\" So even though the statement is about frequency, the evaluation is through the lens of risk. \n\nWait, but the statement is a factual claim about the frequency of adverse events. The Risk Solver's role is to assess whether the statement is correct in terms of the risk (i.e., considering both likelihood and severity). However, the statement here is not making a risk assessment but a frequency claim. \n\nHmm, perhaps the confusion arises here. Let me re-examine the instructions. The user says: \"You are the Risk Solver for Clinical Trial NLI (CTNLI). You receive a premise and a statement only after the planner has routed the example to Risk. Risk is defined as (Exposure to) the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility i.e. Perform expected-harm reasoning: integrate likelihood (explicit counts/rates or qualitative cues) with severity (potential for serious harm), and pay attention to hazards not definitively ruled out.\"\n\nSo the task is to evaluate the statement in terms of risk, which involves both likelihood and severity. The statement in this case is about the frequency of two adverse events. However, the statement's accuracy in terms of frequency might be a factual claim, but the Risk Solver needs to assess whether the statement's assertion about the frequency (and thus the risk) is correct. \n\nWait, the statement says \"patients frequently experienced elevated blood pressure and sleep disturbances.\" The premise provides the frequencies. So if the statement's assertion about frequency is incorrect, then the statement is contradicted. If it's correct, then entailed. If ambiguous, neutral. \n\nBut according to the core principles, the Risk Solver should focus on expected harm (likelihood \u00d7 severity). However, the statement is not about harm but about the frequency of adverse events. So perhaps the task here is to determine whether the statement's description of the frequency (and thus the associated risk) is accurate. \n\nFor example, if the statement says \"frequently experienced elevated blood pressure,\" and the premise reports 11.11%, is that considered \"frequently\"? If in the context, 11% is considered frequent, then the statement is correct. If not, then it's contradicted. \n\nBut the core principles mention that \"expected harm > raw frequency\" but in this case, the statement is about frequency. So perhaps the contradiction arises if the statement overstates the frequency, leading to a misrepresentation of risk. \n\nAlternatively, the statement's use of \"frequently\" might be considered entailed if the rates are non-trivial, especially considering the severity. For example, Hypertension is a serious adverse event, so even 11% could be considered a significant risk, hence \"frequently\" in the context of risk. \n\nBut the problem is that the statement is combining two events: elevated blood pressure (Hypertension at 11.11%) and sleep disturbances (Insomnia at 5.56%). The statement claims both occurred frequently. \n\nIn terms of risk, Hypertension is more severe event (serious) compared to Insomnia (moderate or minor). So even if Hypertension occurs at 11.11%, which is higher than Insomnia's 5.56%, the statement's assertion that both are frequent might be misleading. \n\nBut the question is whether the statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral. If the premise states that Hypertension occurred in 11.11% and Insomnia in 5.56%, and the statement says \"frequently experienced\" both, then the contradiction would be that Insomnia's rate is not frequent. \n\nAlternatively, if \"frequently\" is used in a way that encompasses both events, even if one is less frequent, but the statement groups them together, perhaps the label is contradicted because the combined assertion is inaccurate. \n\nAlternatively, if the statement says \"patients frequently experienced elevated blood pressure and sleep disturbances,\" and the premise shows that 11.11% had hypertension and 5.56% had insomnia, then the use of \"frequently\" for both might be an overstatement, especially for insomnia. \n\nIn clinical trial reporting, adverse events are often categorized as very common (\u226510%), common (\u22651% to <10%), uncommon (\u22650.1% to <1%), etc. If we follow that, hypertension at 11.11% is very common, and insomnia at 5.56% is common. The term \"frequently\" might correspond to \"very common\" or \"common.\" If the statement uses \"frequently\" to mean \"common\" or higher, then hypertension is very common (frequent), and insomnia is common (maybe not as frequent). However, the statement groups both under \"frequently,\" which might not be accurate for insomnia. \n\nTherefore, the statement's claim that both occurred \"frequently\" could be contradicted because insomnia's rate is lower and might not qualify as \"frequent.\" \n\nAlternatively, if \"frequently\" is used more loosely, then perhaps the statement is entailed. But according to the core principles, we should use the provided information strictly. The premise gives exact percentages, and the statement uses \"frequently.\" If the statement's assertion about frequency doesn't align with the premise's data, then it's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the label would be contradiction because the statement claims both events occurred frequently, but insomnia's rate is only 5.56%, which is lower than hypertension's 11.11%, and may not be considered \"frequent.\" \n\nBut wait, the core principles mention that expected harm is likelihood \u00d7 severity. So even if insomnia is less frequent, if it's severe, it contributes to risk. However, the statement is about the frequency of occurrence, not the risk. The problem is whether the statement's assertion about frequency is correct. \n\nBut the task is to evaluate the statement in terms of risk. Wait, the user instruction says: \"Decide whether the statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral by evaluating patient risk.\" So even if the statement is about frequency, the evaluation is through the lens of risk. \n\nBut how does that apply here?\n\nThe statement says that patients frequently experienced these two adverse events. The premise provides their frequencies. The risk assessment would consider both the likelihood (frequency) and severity. \n\nHypertension is a serious adverse event (higher severity), occurring in 11.11% of patients. Insomnia is a less severe event, occurring in 5.56%. \n\nThe statement's assertion that both occurred \"frequently\" could be evaluated in terms of their contribution to overall risk. However, the statement is not about risk but about frequency. \n\nBut perhaps the task is to see if the statement accurately reflects the premise's data. If the premise says 11.11% and 5.56%, and the statement says \"frequently,\" then the contradiction arises if \"frequently\" is an overstatement. \n\nIn clinical trial reporting, \"frequent\" might be considered as \"common\" or higher. If \"common\" is \u22651% and <10%, then 5.56% is common, and 11.11% is very common. So the statement's use of \"frequently\" for hypertension (very common) is correct, but for insomnia (common), \"frequently\" might still be acceptable in lay terms. However, combining both under \"frequently\" might be misleading. \n\nAlternatively, the statement could be considered as entailed because both events occurred in a non-negligible proportion of patients, and the term \"frequently\" is used in a general sense. \n\nBut according to the core principles, we need to use the provided information strictly. The premise reports exact percentages, and the statement uses \"frequently.\" If \"frequently\" is not supported by the data, then it's a contradiction. \n\nGiven that 11.11% is 2/18, which is about 1 in 9 patients. Is that considered frequent? In some contexts, yes, but in others, no. However, in clinical trials, adverse events are often reported with specific frequency categories. For example, as per the CIOMS guidelines:\n\n- Very common: \u226510%\n- Common: \u22651% and <10%\n- Uncommon: \u22650.1% and <1%\n- Rare: \u22650.01% and <0.1%\n- Very rare: <0.01%\n\nIf we follow this, then hypertension at 11.11% is very common, and insomnia at 5.56% is common. The statement says \"frequently experienced,\" which could correspond to \"very common\" or \"common.\" However, the term \"frequently\" might be more aligned with \"very common.\" If the statement groups both as \"frequently,\" then for insomnia, which is common but not very common, this could be a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the statement's assertion that both occurred \"frequently\" is contradicted because insomnia's rate is in the common category, not very common, and thus not \"frequently\" in the same way as hypertension. \n\nAlternatively, if \"frequently\" is used to mean \"common or very common,\" then the statement is correct. But since the core principles require using the information provided and not external knowledge, perhaps we should take the numerical values as given. \n\nThe premise states that hypertension occurred in 11.11% (2/18) and insomnia in 5.56% (1/18). The statement says \"frequently\" for both. If \"frequently\" is interpreted as occurring in a significant number of patients, then 11.11% might be considered frequent, but 5.56% is less so. However, the statement combines both, implying that both are frequent. \n\nIn this case, the statement's claim about insomnia being frequent (5.56%) might be an overstatement, leading to a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the label would be contradiction because the statement asserts that both events occurred frequently, but insomnia's rate is lower and may not meet the threshold for \"frequently.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"1. Extract candidates: Elevated blood pressure (Hypertension, 11.11%) and sleep disturbances (Insomnia, 5.56%) are explicitly listed in the premise. 2. Likelihood: Hypertension occurs in 11.11% (2/18), Insomnia in 5.56% (1/18). 3. Severity: Hypertension is a serious adverse event (risk of cardiovascular complications), while Insomnia is moderate. 4. Statement claims both occurred 'frequently.' Hypertension at 11.11% could be considered frequent in clinical trial contexts (\u226510% = 'very common'), but Insomnia at 5.56% falls under 'common' (1-10%), not 'frequent' by standard adverse event frequency classifications. Combining both under 'frequently' overstates Insomnia's prevalence. 5.
