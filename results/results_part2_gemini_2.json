The severity ordering is: Ischemic stroke \u2248 Anaphylaxis > Atrial fibrillation > Hypotension > Fever > Nausea.\n4. **Compute Comparative Risk**: Risk is defined as the product of likelihood and severity (expected harm). The statement claims the highest risk is from fever. This is based solely on fever's high frequency. However, the core principle is that `Expected harm > raw frequency`. A rare but catastrophic event like an Ischemic stroke (1.52% likelihood \u00d7 very high severity) or Anaphylaxis (3.03% likelihood \u00d7 very high severity) represents a far greater risk to patient well-being than a very common but low-severity event like Fever (33.33% likelihood \u00d7 low-to-moderate severity). The potential for death or permanent disability from stroke or anaphylaxis dominates the risk calculation.\n5. **Evaluate Statement**: The statement that the highest patient risk was associated with fever is contradicted. It incorrectly equates the most common event with the highest risk, ignoring the much higher severity of less common events like Ischemic stroke and Anaphylaxis.",
