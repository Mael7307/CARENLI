Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent often used for various malignancies but is known to potentially cause nephrotoxicity, especially in patients with impaired renal function. The patient would typically be considered at high risk due to his significantly reduced eGFR. This raises significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the treatment regimen in this particular patient. Chronic kidney disease at this level could lead to poor drug clearance, increased toxicity, and may ultimately result in decreased effectiveness of chemotherapy. Additionally, considering the combination of age, renal function, and chemotherapy, achieving disease control and extending progression-free survival might not be practically feasible due to these constraints. Therefore, the statement that 'The regimen is expected to achieve disease control and extend progression-free survival' does not align with the risks and potential complications illustrated by the patient's clinical profile.
