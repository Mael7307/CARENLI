      "reasoning": "1. Extract factors: The premise specifies triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with doxorubicin 90mg/m\u00b2 weekly for 8 weeks. TNBC is aggressive with limited treatment options. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline with a maximum lifetime cumulative dose limit of 450-550mg/m\u00b2 to avoid irreversible cardiotoxicity.\n2. Identify dependencies: Weekly administration (8 doses) at 90mg/m\u00b2 results in a cumulative dose of 720mg/m\u00b2, exceeding safe limits. This creates a dependency conflict between efficacy (statement's claim) and safety (premise's regimen).\n3. Evaluate interactions: The stated regimen would cause dose-limiting cardiac toxicity before achieving therapeutic benefit, making sustained clinical benefit biologically implausible. The regimen violates established pharmacokinetic/dynamic constraints for anthracyclines.\n4. Conclusion: The statement's claim of meaningful tumor shrinkage contradicts the premise's self-defeating dosing schedule that inherently prevents completion of therapy due to toxicity.",
