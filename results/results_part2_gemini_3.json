The premise provides multiple strong supporting factors: \n    *   **Risk Factors**: Postpartum state (a known hypercoagulable period) and prolonged car travel (stasis) are major risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n    *   **Symptoms**: Sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath are classic symptoms of PE.\n    *   **Signs**: The patient is tachycardic (HR 118) and hypoxemic (SpO2 92%), both of which are significant objective signs of a PE. The mild calf discomfort is suggestive of a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the source of most PEs. \n    *   **Initial Workup**: An unremarkable chest X-ray in the presence of significant hypoxemia is a classic finding that increases the suspicion for PE, as it rules out other common causes like large pneumonia or pneumothorax.\n3.  **Assign Severity Ordering**: PE is a life-threatening, catastrophic condition.
