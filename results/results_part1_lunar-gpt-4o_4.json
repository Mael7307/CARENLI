However, the statement claims that atorvastatin 'effectively lowers LDL cholesterol in most patients,' which suggests a majority of patients experienced a notable outcome. In the premise, only 52.4% achieved the target, which is a slight majority but might not definitively satisfy 'most patients.' The evidence does not strongly assert that the intervention is 'effective' in the sense of being impactful for a broader population or beyond this study context, nor does it define an explicit comparator or control group.

Fatigue has the highest reported incidence at 31.25%, but it is a comparatively minor and transient symptom. In contrast, anaphylaxis (3.75%) and respiratory distress (6.25%) are life-threatening and severe conditions despite being less frequent. Risk is calculated by multiplying likelihood and severity, and life-threatening events outweigh minor discomforts even with lower frequency. Consequently, the highest patient risk is not associated with fatigue but with rarer, severe conditions such as anaphylaxis or respiratory distress.
