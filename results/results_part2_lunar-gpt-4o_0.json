However, the statement specifies 'highest patient risk,' which incorporates not only likelihood but also severity. Arthralgia, while frequent, is not life-threatening or associated with irreversible harm and is generally considered minor compared to other adverse events listed. Conversely, torsades de pointes (1.11%), ventricular tachycardia (2.22%), acute kidney injury (5.56%), and pancreatitis (3.33%) are less frequent but have much higher severity due to their potential for life-threatening or serious harm. Since 'highest patient risk' must weigh both likelihood and severity, arthralgia does not qualify as the event with the highest risk. Therefore, the statement is contradicted.",
