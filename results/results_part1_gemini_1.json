Administering it, particularly in an intensive regimen as described, for a diagnosis of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia has a clear and universally understood medical purpose. The primary goal of such a therapy is to destroy leukemia cells, thereby reducing the leukemic burden, with the ultimate aim of inducing remission and improving the patient's chances of survival.\n5. **Synthesize and Label:** The statement accurately articulates the fundamental therapeutic intent of the specific clinical action described in the premise. While the premise doesn't explicitly state the goal, the goal is a direct and necessary implication of administering this type of treatment for this specific disease. The combination of the drug (methotrexate), the diagnosis (relapsed ALL), and the intensive schedule logically and medically implies the goal stated. Therefore, the statement is entailed.",

Highest severity.\n    -   **Mild hypotension:** Can be serious, potentially leading to syncope or reduced organ perfusion. High severity.\n    -   **Dizziness:** Can indicate systemic issues and increases fall risk. Moderate severity.\n    -   **Fatigue, Headache, Rash, Injection site reaction:** Generally considered minor and non-life-threatening adverse events. Low severity.\n4.  **Compute comparative risk (Likelihood \u00d7 Severity):** The statement claims the highest risk is associated with fatigue. I must compare the risk of fatigue with the risk of other events, particularly the most severe one, anaphylaxis.\n    -   **Risk from Fatigue:** High Likelihood (41.67%) \u00d7 Low Severity. The expected harm is significant due to frequency but the outcome is not life-threatening.\n    -   **Risk from Anaphylaxis:** Low Likelihood (5.00%) \u00d7 Extremely High Severity (life-threatening). The expected harm is dominated by the catastrophic potential of the outcome.\n    -   A 5% chance of a life-threatening event like anaphylaxis constitutes a far greater patient risk than a 41.67% chance of experiencing fatigue. The principle of 'expected harm > raw frequency' dictates that the rare but catastrophic event poses the highest risk.\n5.  **Evaluate the statement:** The statement asserts that fatigue is the highest risk. The analysis shows that anaphylaxis, despite being less common, represents a significantly higher risk due to its extreme severity. Therefore, the statement is contradicted by the premise.",
